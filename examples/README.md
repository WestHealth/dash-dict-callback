# Examples

The examples are taken from the Dash documentation and ported from using the `callback` decorator to the `dict_callback` decorator. Because these examples are not too complex the value might not be seen right away. 

## Basic

Ported from  https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks

## Advanced

Ported from https://dash.plotly.com/advanced-callbacks

## Pattern

Ported https://dash.plotly.com/pattern-matching-callbacks

Currently only first two have been ported. Will port the remainder when I have time

## Complex

TBD will include more complicated callback examples. There will be a readme in that folder when the time comes.
